# Scrum

**Scrum** is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems.

## Scrum Theory

Scrum is founded on *empiricism* and *lean thinking*:

- **Empiricism** asserts thath knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is observed.
- **Lean thinking** reduces waste and focuses on the essentials.

Scrum employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and to controll risk.

## Scrum Pillars

### Transparency

The emergent process and work must be visible to those performing the work as well as those receiving.

To help with transparency, Scrum provide three formal artifacts.

Transparency enables inspection.

### Inspection

The Scrum artifacts and the progress toward agreed goals must be inspected frequentl and diligently to detect potentially undesiderable variance of problems.

To help with inspection, Scrum provides cadence in the form of five events.

Inspection enables adaptation.

### Adaptation

If any aspect of a process deviate outside acceptable limits, the process being applied must be *adjusted*.

A Scrum Team is expected to adapt the moment it learns anthing new through inspection.

## Scrum Values

Scrum values:

- Commitment
- Focus
- Openness
- Respect
- Courage

The Scrum Team *commit* to achieving its goals and supporting each other.

Their primary *focus* is on the work of the Sprint to make the best possible progress towards these goals.

The Scrum Team and the stakeholders are *open* about the work and the challanges.

Scrum Team members *respect* each others to be capable, indipendent people, and are respected as such by the people with whom they work.

The Scrum Team members have the *courage* to do the right thing, to work on tough problems.

## Scrum Team

The Scrum Team consist of one *Scrum Master*, one *Product Owner* and *Developers*. It is a cohesive unit of professionals focused on one objective at time, the *Product Goals*.

- Scrum Team are *cross functional*: members have all the skills necessary to create value each Sprint.
- Scrum Team are *self-managed*: internally they decide who does what, when and how.
- Scrum Team are small: 10 or fewer people.

### Developers

Developers are the people in the Scrum Team that are committed to create any aspect of a usable incrment each Sprint.

The Developers are accountable for:

- Create a plan for the Sprint (Sprint Backlog)
- Instilling quality by adhering to the definition of done
- Adapting their plan each day toward the  Sprint Goal
- Holding each other accountable as professionals.

### Product Owner

The Product Owner is accountable for maximazing the value of the product resulting from the work of the scrum team and is also accountable for effective Product backlog management:

- developing and  explicitly communicating the Product Goal
- creating and clearly communicating Product Backlog Items
- ordering Product Backlog Items
- ensurig that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible and understood.

### Scrum Master

The Scrum Master is accountable for enstablishing Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide. Scrum Masters are true leaders who servers Scrum Team and the larger organization.

The Scrum Master serves the Scrum Team in several ways:

- coaching the team members in self-management and cross-functionality
- helping the Scrum Team focus on creating high-value increments that meets the Definition of Done
- causing the removal of impediments to the Scrum Team's progress
- ensuring that all the Scrum events take place and are positive, productive, and keept within the timebox.

The Scrum Master serves the Product Owner in several ways:

- helping find techniques for effective Product Goal definition and Product Backlog management
- helping the Scrum Team understand the need for clear and concise Product Backlog items
- helping establish empirical product planning for a complex environment
- facilitating stakeholder collaboration as requested or needed.

The Scrum Master serves the organization in several ways, including:

- leading, training, and coaching the organization in its Scrum adoption
- planning and advising Scrum implementations within the organization
- helping employees and stakeholders understand and enact an empirical approach for complex
work
- removing barriers between stakeholders and Scrum Teams.

## Scrum Events

Each event in Scrum is a formal opportunity to inspect and adapt Scrum artifacts. Events are
used in Scrum to create regularity and to minimize the need for meetings not defined in Scrum.

### The Sprint

The Sprint is a container for all other events. They are fixed length events of one month or less to create consistency.

During the Sprint:

- no changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal
- quality does not decrease
- the Product Backlog is refined as needed
- scope may be clarified and renegotiated with the Product Owner as more is learned.

A Sprint could be cancelled if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete. Only the Product Owner has the
authority to cancel the Sprint.

### Sprint Planning

Sprint Planning initiates the Sprint by laying out the work to be performed for the Sprint. This resulting
plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team.

Sprint Planning addresses the following topics:

- **Topic One: Why is this Sprint valuable?** The Product Owner proposes how the product could increase its value and utility in the current Sprint. The whole Scrum Team then collaborates to define a *Sprint Goal* that communicates why the Sprint is valuable to stakeholders. The Sprint Goal must be finalized prior to the end of Sprint Planning.
- **Topic Two: What can be Done this Sprint?** Through discussion with the Product Owner, the Developers select items from the Product Backlog to include in the current Sprint.
- **Topic Three: How will the chosen work get done?** For each selected *Product Backlog Item*, the Developers plan the work necessary to create an Increment that meets the *Definition of Done*. No one else tells Devlopers how to turn Product Backlog items into Increments of value.

The *Sprint Goal*, the *Product Backlog Items* selected for the Sprint, plus the plan for delivering them are
together referred to as the *Sprint Backlog*.

Sprint Planning is timeboxed to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month Sprint.

### Daily Scrum

The purpose of the Daily Scrum is to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint
Backlog as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work.

The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute event for the Developers of the Scrum Team.

If the Product Owner or Scrum Master are actively working on items in the Sprint Backlog, they participate as Developers.

### Sprint Review

The purpose of the Sprint Review is to inspect the outcome of the Sprint and determine future adaptations. The Scrum Team presents the results of their work to key stakeholders and progress toward the Product Goal is discussed.

The Sprint Review is the second to last event of the Sprint and is timeboxed to a maximum of four hours for a one-month Sprint.

### Sprint Retrospective

The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness. The Scrum Team inspects how the last Sprint went with regards to individuals, interactions, processes, tools, and their *Definition of Done*.

The Scrum Team discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems it encountered, and how those problems were (or were not) solved.

The Sprint Retrospective concludes the Sprint. It is timeboxed to a maximum of three hours for a one month Sprint.

## Scrum Artifacts

Scrum's artifacts represent work or value. They are designed to maximize transparency of key information.

### Product Backlog

The Product Backlog is an emergent, ordered list of what is needed to improve the product. It is the single source of work undertaken by the Scrum Team.

*Product Backlog refinement* is the act of breaking down and further defining Product Backlog items into smaller more precise items.

#### Commitment: Product Goal

The Product Goal describes a future state of the product which can serve as a target for the Scrum Team to plan against. The Product Goal is in the Product Backlog. The Product Goal is the long-term objective for the Scrum Team.

### Sprint Backlog

The Sprint Backlog is composed of the Sprint Goal (why), the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint (what), as well as an actionable plan for delivering the Increment (how).

The Sprint Backlog is a plan by and for the Developers.

#### Commitment: Sprint Goal

The Sprint Goal is the single objective for the Sprint. The Sprint Goal is created during the Sprint Planning event and then added to the Sprint Backlog.

### Increment

An Increment is a concrete stepping stone toward the Product Goal. The sum of the Increments is presented at the Sprint Review thus supporting empiricism.

#### Commitment: Definition of Done

The Definition of Done is a formal description of the state of the Increment when it meets the quality measures required for the product. The Developers are required to conform to the Definition of Done.
