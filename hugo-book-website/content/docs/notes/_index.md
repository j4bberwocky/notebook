## Introduction

In this sort of book you'll find all the notes and thoughts I made on a variety of topics, such as elementary Number Theory, DevOps, spirituality and Christian Theology, Software Engineering, Software Architecture or programming.

The goal is to document, store and share all the knowledge gathered throughout my everyday life.
