## Notebook

This is my personal _notebook_ hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/) in the form of [GitHub Page](https://pages.github.com/).

The primary motivation for creating this site was the need of a place to collect, document and share my learnings and my thoughts. I use writing as a tool for thinking, and here you will find this: _writings_ on everything that I found intresting.

Thi site is build with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) & the beautiful [hugo-book](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book) theme. If you are intrested on how I set up the site take a look [here]({{< relref "posts/how-i-set-up-this-site.md" >}} "How I Set Up This Site").
